                    In an effort to take my knowledge up a notch or two, I am currently studying HTML, CSS, and
                    Javascript. With that note in mind, I will probably upgrade this blog in order to ‘hack’ the design
                    elements in it. I am currently keeping my practice files on GitHib in a private repo. But, have no
                    fear, once my knowledge grows, I will bring some of the design files I have been working on to light
                    in a repo of their own.</h1>
